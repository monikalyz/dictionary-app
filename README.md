## Technologies Used

* HTML5

* CSS3

* JavaScript ES6

* React

* Photoshop

* Styled Components

## Features

* One page application

* Fully responsive

* Easy to use

* Language learning

* Code optimization using destructuring

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Usage

### This application can be broken down into 5 steps

1. Enter the words to learn and add them to your own newly created dictionary.

2. When you click the "open eye" button, the dictionary is shown and you can delete words or just look at what's inside. However, when you click on the "closed eye" button, the dictionary disappears (this step is optional).

3. Then choose the language of the random word (Polish or English).

4. Next, you need to press the "play" button and the randomly selected word is displayed.

5. Enter the answer and press the "check" button, after which information will be displayed whether the answer was correct or not. If the answer was correct, the words are removed from the dictionary.

### This application includes methods of

* showing the typed English word

* showing the typed Polish word

* clearing all fields after clicking on the field to enter English or Polish word

* adding words to the dictionary (you must put the word in english and the corresponding word in polish, otherwise you won't be able to add anything to the dictionary)

* showing and disappearing dictionary

* selecting the language of a random word

* drawing a word

* changing the content into an input where is the user's answer

* checking if the word entered by the user is correct

* removing words from the dictionary if the user answered correctly

And destructuring, which optimizes the code and the function component which includes an English and Polish word and a delete button (it is inside the dictionary after adding words by the user)

### This app can be expanded with additional enhancements such as

* saving the user dictionary in the application memory, so that the user does not have to enter words into the dictionary every time she/he re-opens the application
